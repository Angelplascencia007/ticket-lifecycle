<p>2. Assignment and Communication
<p>The ticket is assigned to an appropriate agent or department.
<p>The priority and SLA (Service Level Agreement) are set.
<p>The agent communicates with the user to gather more information or to provide updates.

<p>3. Working the Issue
<p>The assigned agent works on resolving the issue.
<p>The agent may update the ticket with progress notes and communicate with the user as needed.

<p>4. Resolution
<p>Once the issue is resolved, the agent updates the ticket status to "Resolved".
<p>The ticket is then closed, completing the lifecycle.
